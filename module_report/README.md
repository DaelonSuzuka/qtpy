# Module Report


Creating the reports:

- delete .venv if present
- `python -m venv .venv`
- activate .venv
- `python -m pip install -r module_reports/packages.txt`
- `python -m module_report import_report.txt`
- `python -m pip install -r module_reports/packages-all.txt`
- `python -m module_report import_report_all.txt`


The module report is generated by inspecting site-packages, getting the list of all the modules in each of the 4 Qt APIs, and then attempting to import each module from qtpy. The import report is just the exceptions generated during this import test. Successful imports generate no output.

Each entry in the report is the text of the error that's raised. Any entry that starts with `PythonQtError` is actually a success, because it indicates an invalid import that is correctly handled. Any entry that starts with `ModuleNotFoundError` is a failure, because it is in an invalid import that is NOT correctly handled.
